  <h2>10 Second Life Story</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Location: Boulder, CO</li>
    <li>Current Degree: BS Computer Science and BA Japanese at the University of Colorado Boulder</li>
    <li>Current Occupation: Software Engineer at <a href="http://rallydev.com" target="_blank">Rally Software</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>I'm a developer currently working in Boulder, Colorado. I have a number of passions, ranging from software development as a craft to basketball. My current occupation at Rally Software taught a significant number of fundamentals to become a contributer and leader in software projects. Pair programming, well tested code, and basic agile practices are a core part of what makes me an software engineer. That said, I'm always open to new perspectives, it's the only way to thrive as a developer and as a person.</p>

<div class="language-use">
  <h2>Languages</h2>

  <p>My resume says otherwise, but here's the top languages that I most frequenly dabble in. The list is in order of most used in a typical day at work and home.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Japanese</li>
  </ul>

  <p>One of those languages is not like this others and I believe, the most challenging one I have ever encountered.</p>

  <h2>Other Interests</h2>

  <p>I love to bike around town, especially to and from work. I also have an unatural obsession with disc golf, which I attempt everyday to get one game in before the sun sets. You can also convince me to try other sports or invite me for a beer. Both questions will get a favorable answer from me.</p>

  <p>I try to make this website as simple as possible with respect to everyone and every device. Let me know if I fail hard at this task.</p>
